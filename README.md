# Pacman game with a self-learning algorithm 

This is a hobby project meant to learn more about machine learning algorithms and corresponding libraries in Python. It is inspired by one of my first coding projects which was exactly an implementation of a Pacman game. This time I will first use pygame library to re-write the game logic properly and then implement a learning algorithm for autoplay.
